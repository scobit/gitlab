Environment Variables - in every pipeline Gitlab provides predefined variables.
List of predefined variables in Gitlab docs available.

Predefined Variables doc:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html

Use case of variables:
Storing values you want to re-use multiple times.
Reducing code duplication.

Project Variables - stored outside the git repository (not in the .gitlab-ci.yml).
Ideal for tokens and passwords, which should not be included in the repository for security reasons.

Variables should be in upper case.

Variables definitions
1. define variable in a job:
only that job can use it

2. define variable at top level of the file:
globally available and all jobs can use it

Variables saved in the file directly should store only non-sensitive data, because the values will be visible in the repository.
